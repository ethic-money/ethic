## What is ∉thic?

∉thic is a stablecoin that is meant to revolutionize the role of money, and to usher in greater responsibility and professionalism to the DeFi world. The symbol for ∉thic is the mathematical sign, **∉**, meaning "Not an element of" (a set). This is meant to express ∉thic's core mission to define a stable, ethical store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange that is not an element of the unethical systems that comprise fiat monies, as well as to pay homage to the EmptySetSquad who anonymously authored the underlying smart contract framework ∉thic is built upon.

∉thic is the first "Set Dollar Protocol" developed by a publicly revealed developer with a strong, multi-year track record in blockchain. Douglas Horn lead the creation of the Telos blockchain in 2018 as a highly successful no-ICO blockchain and community in 2018. In October 2020, [his call for higher DeFi standards](https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-chance-for-defi-to-fulfill-the-technology-s-promise) was published by Cointelegraph outlining his five hallmarks of responsible DeFi:

* Publicly identified, experienced founders
* Rewards every crucial member of the ecosystem
* No pre-mine or robbable developer pool - Developer funds generated along the way
* Governance prioritized, easy and deterministic
* Protection from "rug-pulls" and code errors

∉thic is designed to fulfill each of these requirements and set a new Gold Standard for responsible, safe DeFi offerings.

**∉thic is:**

### Ethical

* An opt-in monetary system anyone is free to interact with or not
* Derives its value from the actions and decisions of users
* Owned and governed entirely by users
* No pre-sales, early mining, or special classes of ownership - everyone has an equal opportunity to participate
* Rewards all critical participants for their role
* To the greatest extent feasible, minimizes electrical usage and offsets its ecological impacts

### Decentralized & Community Governed

* Built on the Ethereum blockchain
* Entirely governed by ETHC token-holders
* Epoch length, rewards, developer rewards recipients and all other configuration parameters will be governed by the ETHC token holders

### Self-stabilizing & Self-sustaining

* Programmatically aligns the current value of ETHC towards an economic standard (currently the US Dollar but changable through governance)
* No pre-mined reserve or developer pool to risk rug-pulls
* Developer rewards are generated with each new epoch to incentivize developer longevity and continuing efforts
* Project Proposal System driven and voted by community members to perform additional marketing, education, services and outreach as voted by the ETHC token holders

### Not an Element of Fiat Monetary Systems

* ∉thic seeks to track the value of the Maker DAI cryptocurrency, which, itself, tracks the US Dollar, but is programmatically derived and stable. 
* Free from the risks of unregulated USD stablecoins (e.g. The funds aren't actually there)
* Free from the risks of government regulation of stablecoins meant to track the US Dollar directly

## Dashboard

A simple [dashboard](https://github.com/ethic-money/ethic-dashboard) for interacting with the ∉thic protocol.

## Litepaper

The [∉thic Litepaper](https://github.com/ethic-money/ethic/blob/master/xxxxx.pdf) describes unique features of ∉thic among Set Dollar Protocols, originally developed in the [Empty Set Dollar Whitepaper](https://github.com/emptysetsquad/dollar/blob/master/d%C3%B8llar.pdf).

## Community Owned and Governed

∉thic is entirely owned and operated by the community of ETHC token holders. V1 governance will exist on Ethereum's Aragon but will rapidly (within 3 months of launch) migrate to V2 governance on the Telos Decide governance system which will allow benefits including:

* Free voting on all ballots
* Deterministic Cross-Chain Interaction (CCI) to Ethereum to exectue ballot outcomes
* Fast, easy voting experience via the custom ∉thic Voting Wallet mobile app 

## Open Source Software - A Legacy of Contributions

∉thic aims to honor the legacy of open source software by first acknowledging the long line ofcontributions of developers over the past 70 years of computer science and particularly cryptocurrencies. A portion of the developer fees will be paid to EmptySetSquad for their contributions and the first governance votes on ∉thic will determine which other service providers or developers (e.g. Metamask, Ethereum developers, etc.) the ETHC token holders wish to also include in the ongoing developer reward structure. 

Rewarding developers incentivizes them to remain with a project, uncovering bugs, developing new and improved features and listening to the community that controls their fees. This is the ultimate predictor of a project that will grow and thrive over years to come.

## Disclaimer
This project is an experiment in decentralize finance and monetary systems. Its contracts are unaudited but based on previously audited open source software code. These contracts operate on a blockchain with dependencies on open source software code and price oracles that are accessed by wallet applications on computer operating systems - all are build using a variety of frameworks, programming languages and code libraries believed to be reliable but outside the control of the developers. Bugs, errors and exploits unknown to the developers may exist or be discovered or introduced at any layer or step in the technology stack of components that make this application operate. All participants should take great caution when interacting with this experimental software. The loss of some or all funds contributed to this experimental system is possibilite. The developers disavow any fiduciary responsibility, custodianship or legal or moral responsibilities for losses resulting from anything outside their direct, explicit, intentioned actions.
